# Kalman-And-Particle-Filter
Implementation of Kalman filter and condensation algorithm--A type of particle filter-- in python.


kalman.py will track a ball in 10m* 10m* 10m 3-D space</br>
kalman-gui.py will use mouse as an object and track it's movement</br>
condensation.py will use condensation algorithm to will use mouse as an object and track it's movement
condensation_live.py will use condensation algorithm, you can either use live camera(if you don't give any CLI argument) or you can give a video as input.
